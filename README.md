# DynaGlow_Attire-IoT-Project
The DynaGlow Attire is a wearable technology project where I utilized Adafruit Circuit Playground, integrating various sensors to control LED lights based on user actions, motions, and sensor inputs. The dress is designed to be interactive and responsive to the wearer's movements, creating a visually engaging and dynamic display.
